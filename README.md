# CS255 Project: DriverPass System Analysis 

# What is DriverPass?

DriverPass is a hypothetical client who wishes to have a software system built to help people get their driver licenses. They desire the system to be accessible by their customers over the internet, and also wish to have access themselves in order to help their clients or add new material and perform maintenance actions. 

# What did you do particularly well?

This is a first attempt at system design documentation and I believe it does a good job representing the system in a way that can be translated to a development team. The steps and functions required are clearly laid out in a variety of formats. Especially helpful are the different diagrams that I was able to build for this project as it helps the team to understand the DriverPass system in terms of software instead of just customer requirements.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The documentation presented could benefit from additional activity or sequence diagrams to describe all the use cases that customer requires of this system. Only a few sample diagrams were built for this project. Having a complete set of diagrams is critical because they describe exactly how the system should function for each use case. Without a complete set some parts of the design can be left up to interpretation in development and it may be that the end result is not exactly as the customer desired.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

One of the most important roles of a system analyst is translating customer requirements into system requirements. Clients may or may not understand how software systems are built, but they absolutely understand what they want from the system nonetheless. The requirements from the customer were gathered in the form of an interview. Each piece of information given from the interview was then organized into functional or nonfunctional system requirements, and from there a complete business requirements document was created presenting this information plus outlining necessary technical requirements.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

In designing a software system it is most important to completely understand the client requirements. This may involve multiple meetings, iterative development, and/or examining any current processes they have in place that this sytem will take over. After this, it is important to select proper constraints and necessities that will then influence the choice of technologies that go toward building the system. Capturing these requirements, translating them, and setting system boundaries create the outline of the system to be built and encompass the role of the system analyst.
